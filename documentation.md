# Chatroom

## Table of contents

# Features
- Created a basic UI for a chatroom where the user can join one of the 4 rooms and interact with other users in the same room using socket.io.
- The users in the room recieve intuitive updates for when a user joins, leaves or sends a message to the room.
- The teacher can allow/disallow students from sending messages to the chat
- The students can raise hands to request the teacher to allow them to send a message
- Updated UI

# To be added
- Change the UI according to the main design
- Add a *"user is typing"* placeholder for when any user is typing in the message input box
- Further changes as suggested by the team

## Bugs
- If there are more than 1 teachers and one of the teachers allows/disallows a student to send messages, the buttons on the UI of the other teachers do not change.
